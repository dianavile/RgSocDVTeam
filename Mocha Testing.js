/*WORKFLOW
* 1) Download Node JS at https://nodejs.org/en/
- (NOTE: to check which Node version you have installed: in terminal: `node -p process.versions.v8`)
* 2) Use npm to install Mocha: npm install mocha
* - (NOTE: npm installs Mocha in node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha. To run Mocha test: `node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha test`)
* - (NOTE: By default, Mocha will run test.js in current folder.)
* 3) Add Assertion Library to Mocha
* (Assertion library= result checking code to validate tests.)
* (NOTE: most testing frameworks come with one built in.)
* 4) Create a Directory tree structure
* The Main subdirectory holding the classes/functions = `c:\project\mocha\ (under test)`
* The unit tests = `c: \spikes\ mocha\ test`
* 5) Create a Test class
* 6) Create a "failing" class and run mocha against it
* 7) Change the assertion message(error message) (= most important part of code)
* 8) Implement function into main class to make it work
* 9) Run mocha to go green 
* 10) if TEST passes= commit change

//See Mocha Testing file
//REMARKS, I understand the process, but think at the end I still forgetting something, for Mocha testing not worked fully for me.
