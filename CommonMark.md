# Common Mark

### What is Common Mark?
A `standard, unambiguous syntax specification for Markdown`, along with a `suite of comprehensive tests to validate Markdown implementations against this specification`. 

### What is Markdown?
Markdown is
- `a plain text format for writing structured documents, based on formatting conventions from email and usenet.`
- Developed in 2004 by John Gruber, who wrote the first markdown-to-html converter in Perl.
- It soon became widely used in websites. 
- By 2014 there were dozens of implementations in many languages.

### Why Common Mark is needed?
- Markdown lacks _unambiguous syntax specification_.
- Markdown lacks a _compresensive Test suite_.
