# Let´s get started
We, Violeta and Diana Vilé, are involved in the [Rails Girls Summer of Code scholarship](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) as the DV Team since 2nd of July. We met each other in November 2017 during  the [Udacity Front-end Web Developer (FEND) Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001), for which we both received a full Google scholarship. This article shares our __experiences and learnings of pair coding during the Rails Girls Summer of Code scholarship__ (july 2th- september 30th 2018). 

## EXPERIENCE: How to do pair programming in remote
Pure excitement, is what we felt [when we got accepted](https://twitter.com/LSGorg/status/998830730405990400) for the Rails Girls Summer of Code scholarship. We couldn´t wait to start pair coding on the Open Source project ["Living Style Guide"](https://livingstyleguide.org/) together. We felt very privileged to be part of the Rails Girls Summer of Code community. Knowing it would become a busy summer, it didn´t long to realize we needed to prepare ourselves.

#### Getting ready
Even before the Rails Girls Summer of Code experience started, life have been hectic, combining both a full-time job and complete opposite workschedules. Yet we managed to meet each other once or twice a week. 
In the days before the official start: 

1) We both attended a [Scrum Workshop](https://twitter.com/artnerdnet/status/1012799490456158209) giving by our Coach @cristina_verdi.

2) And met for a strategy session to [Plan and Research for @RailsGirlsSoC](https://twitter.com/artnerdnet/status/1012799490456158209)

#### First day
The first day, we prepared ourselves reading the [@RailsGirlsSoC guidelines](https://twitter.com/artnerdnet/status/1010835368051138560), looked into the Code and attended the [@RailsGirlsSoC Kick-Off event](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2018-06-28-lets-get-rgsoc-started)

#### Struggling to find a way 
Shortly afterwards, we realized one thing: starting to code and do pair programming in remote isn´t easy:

- We didn´t understand the code. Not even a tiny bit. We realized we needed to learn a lot.
- We [struggled to focus after a long working day](https://twitter.com/artnerdnet/status/1015567892081979393)
- Our work schedules were completely the opposite. We needed to find a way to work together.
- We realized we both had a different learning style. While @V moves quickly forward, Diana needed more time to stick with the basics.

#### Pair programming
We decided to let our coaches be the bridge between our tight schedules and different learning styles. While, Violeta´s attended her [first tech conference](https://twitter.com/artnerdnet/status/1015883042462818305), Diana sticked with the basics learning [Git, Version Control and Github](https://github.com/dianavile/RgSocDVTeam/blob/master/General%20Workflow%20Git%2C%20Version%20Control%20and%20Github.md). While Diana is still catching up with Violeta´s speed, luckily we could communicate openly about it. Pair programming, especially almost fully remote, is hard, but even then still you can [enjoy working even Friday night](https://twitter.com/artnerdnet/status/1017905655422881793).

### Lessons Learned 
- Preparation is key, but don´t stick in it too long. Learn as much as you can, but __Start working and keep going.__
- Coding is everything except being "a loner". To code, you need to communicate. Especially in remote settings, __communication is key__.
- Pair programming is challenging, coding is hard, communication in remote is prone to misunderstanding. Despite this, attending the Rails Girls Summer of Code is really rewarding. No more playing around, we are really preparing ourselves to become professional front-end- developers.
